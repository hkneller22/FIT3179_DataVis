                        In Australia, the funding disparities between public and private schools contribute to significant differences in educational outcomes. Public schools, which educate the majority of students, rely heavily on government funding, which is often stretched thin. Private schools, while also receiving government funding, supplement their budgets with substantial tuition fees and private donations, giving them access to more resources, advanced facilities, and specialized programs. 
                        <b>This difference in funding per student is visualised by the size of the orange circles in the figure beside, with the size of the circles being encoded by the ratio of total per-student funding between public and private students.</b>
                        <i>Ideally</i>, the ratio should be atleast 1, but this is only true in the ACT.
                        <br><br>
                        This creates an unequal playing field, where students in private schools benefit from smaller class sizes, individualized attention, and broader extracurriculars. As a result, private school students often outperform their public school peers in standardized tests. These outcomes are further influenced by the socio-economic backgrounds of the students, as wealthier families are more likely to afford private education.
                        <b>The colour of a state is encoded by the difference in percentage of students performing above the National Minimum Standards (NMS), between the highest and lowest income brackets.</b>
                        Starkly, the NT has a difference of upwards of 60 percent! 
                        <br><br>
                        This systemic inequality raises concerns about the fairness of the education system, as public schools are often left under-resourced, limiting opportunities for students who cannot afford private education.
