                        Australia is facing challenges in both education outcomes and the job market, raising concerns about the future of its workforce. Educational performance, particularly in literacy and numeracy, has been declining across schools for years. This trend affects the preparedness of graduates for the job market, which itself is becoming more competitive and fragmented. 
                        <br><br>
                        Many university graduates are struggling to find work in their field of study, often resorting to underemployment or casual positions. Compounding this issue, Australia has become popular for international students, particularly from countries like <b>India</b> and <b>China</b>.
                        <br><br>
                        These students often stay in Australia after graduation, contributing to the skilled labor force. However, this influx of talent creates additional competition in an already saturated job market. As a result, domestic and international graduates are facing a difficult pathway to securing meaningful employment, highlighting the need for reform to ensure Australia's future workforce can meet the evolving demands of the economy.
                        <br><br>
                        The adjacent figure highlights the number of foreign-born people in Australia, and their associated qualification levels. Interestingly, there are a large number of <b>English</b> and <b>New Zealand</b> peoples with no qualifications above highschool. In addition, <b>graduate diploma's</b> aren't very popular with ANY group.
