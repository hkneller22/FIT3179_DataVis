                        The high cost of university education in Australia is a growing concern for students and families. Tuition fees have steadily increased over the years, especially for degrees in fields like <b>law</b>, <b>business</b>, and <b>the arts</b>. 
                        <br><br>
                        For domestic students, the governmentâ€™s Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS-HELP) provides loans to cover fees, but this still leaves many with significant debt upon graduation. International students face even higher costs, often paying two to three times more than local students. Additionally, the rising cost of living in major cities such as Sydney and Melbourne adds further financial pressure. The combination of tuition fees, living expenses, and the long-term impact of student debt makes pursuing higher education a significant financial burden in Australia.
                        <br><br>
                        Indexation of student loans, particularly for domestic students using the Higher Education Loan Program (HELP), is another concern. HELP loans are indexed annually to inflation, meaning the debt grows over time, particularly in periods of high inflation. This can disproportionately affect students who take longer to repay their loans or those on lower incomes, as their debts can increase even while their ability to repay remains limited. 
                        <br><br>
